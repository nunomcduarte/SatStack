### Current Technical Challenges

1. **Supabase Integration**
   - Handling server component cookies with Supabase
   - Adapting authentication flows to work in both development and production
   - Handling middleware authentication checks

2. **Next.js Server Components**
   - Ensuring proper separation between server and client components
   - Handling authentication state in server components
   - Managing async server actions

## Next Steps

1. **Database Schema Implementation**
   - Create Supabase tables according to schema
   - Set up Row Level Security policies
   - Create user profile trigger
   - Add indexes for performance

2. **Transaction Management**
   - Implement transaction CRUD operations
   - Create transaction list view
   - Add transaction filtering and sorting
   - Implement transaction import/export

3. **Tax Calculation**
   - Implement FIFO tax lot tracking
   - Create tax lot allocation algorithm
   - Calculate short-term and long-term gains
   - Generate tax summary reports

4. **User Interface Enhancements**
   - Add data visualization components
   - Improve responsiveness and accessibility
   - Implement empty states and loading states
   - Add user preferences

5. **Subscription Management**
   - Integrate Stripe for payments
   - Create subscription tiers
   - Implement feature restrictions based on tier
   - Add billing management interface

## Technical Decisions

### Authentication

We chose Supabase for authentication because:
- It provides a complete auth system with email/password and OAuth
- It integrates with the database for user management
- It includes JWT handling and session management
- It offers a development mode option for testing

### Database Schema

The database schema was designed with:
- User-centric data model where all entities are tied to a user
- Specific tables for transactions, tax lots, and disposals
- Row-level security to ensure data isolation
- Trigger for creating user profiles on signup

### UI Framework

We chose TailwindCSS because:
- It provides a utility-first approach for consistent styling
- It includes built-in responsive design utilities
- It supports dark mode out of the box
- It integrates well with Next.js

### State Management

We chose React Context for state management because:
- It's built into React with no additional dependencies
- It's suitable for the authentication and user state
- It works well with React's component model
- It supports both server and client components

## Lessons Learned

1. **Next.js Server Components**
   - Server components require careful handling of async/await
   - Cookie management in server components can be challenging
   - Error handling needs to be robust for server components

2. **Supabase Integration**
   - Supabase requires proper environment variable setup
   - Cookie-based authentication needs special handling in Next.js
   - Testing Supabase connections early helps identify issues

3. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Strong typing helps catch errors early
   - TypeScript configuration needs careful attention
   - Type definitions for external libraries can be challenging
